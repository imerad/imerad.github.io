About me
======

I am currently a PhD student in applied mathematics  at [LPSM](https://www.lpsm.paris/), Université Paris Cité (Paris 7) under the supervision of [Stéphane Gaïffas](https://stephanegaiffas.github.io/) and [Emmanuel Bacry](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~bacry/).

My main research interests are at the intersection of Machine Learning, Robust statistics and Optimization.
